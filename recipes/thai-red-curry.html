    <h2>Delicious recipe for Thai red curry noodles that can be made in under 30 minutes!</h2>
    <p>This recipe is an amazing cross between a <strong>Thai curry dish and a Thai noodle dish.</strong>  This recipe is made with rice noodles, curry paste, and coconut milk creating a deliciously creamy noodle bowl. </p>
    <p>If you would like to add protein, make extra sauce and add in cooked chicken breast pieces at the end.  You could also add scrambled eggs to the noodles for added flavor and protein.</p>
